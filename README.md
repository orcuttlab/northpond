North Pond FLOCs and Electrochemistry

NP_flocs_ec_seqproc.Rmd can be downloaded and ran with the fastq files in NCBI Sequence Read Archive BioProject PRJNA564565 to recreate the set of ASVs and the accompanying count tables.  This workflow produced the ASVs in https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00011 along with the FLOCs ASVs.  The samples used in these two studies were both sampled from the same field site at the same time so they were run together for better cross-refencing.  

NP_FLOCs_STATs outlines example code for the removal of contaminant ASVs,  data cleaning prior to beta diversity tests, and the code for ordinations and differential abundance tests.  The example code can be used with the metadata file to recreate all statistical tests described in the analysis.
